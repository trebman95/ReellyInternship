<h1>Reelly</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I will walkthrough my responsibilities as a Software QA Engineer for Reelly. Performing functional, UI, smoke and regression testing. Also participating in daily stand-ups and sprint planning using Agile methodologies. Reelly is a web/mobile app that consolidates Dubai developer projects, enabling agents to quickly create personalized property offers and track buyer behavior analytics. Executing test cases and tracking bug issues in Jira was a very interesting task to learn as I know that they will be very essential skills to know while starting off in software quality assurance.
